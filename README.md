## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS] (https://tailwindcss.com)
- [VisualStudioCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com)

### What I learned

The are multiple things I learnt, but the main ones are:
- Tailwind: I used tailwindCSS over the regular CSS. I learnt how to configure it with HTML5 and get it to display in my browser (Brave) when I made changes using Visual Studio Code.
- CSS properties: learnt how to  use various CSS properties such as containers, div's, flex, content positioning (justify, align, item, and text). How to manipulate text (fonts, colors, size, text and typography).

```html
<!-- image div -->
<div class="order-1 md:order-2 md:w-1/2">
  <div class="relative mix-blend-lighten md:shrink-0">
    <img src="./assets/images/image-header-desktop.jpg"alt="BackgroundImage" class="h-full w-full object-cover">
    <div class="absolute opacity-55 h-full w-full item flex items-center justify-center inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-[#b33aff] to-[#b33aff]">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
The above code is how I achieved the overlay/gradient effect. It's not perfect but it was the most meaningful part of this project and something that required a lot of research.

### Continued development

  In the future I would like to solidify my skills with grids, gradients, and animations.

Challenges faced: 
- #1: Using image overlay/gradients to get the required image look. I found it harder with Tailwind but know how to it with regular CSS, I just require more practice.
- #2: Getting the image to the right side of the card in a mobile first, responsive design approach is something I didn't know how to do before this challenge, turns out you just have to change the order on mobile view and desktop view.
